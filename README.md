# Dark-Passages
This is a project I decided to create after seeing a tutorial online on how to make a cool "Glitch Effect" when a mouse hovers over an image (or taps on mobile) with some CSS Tricks. I decided a fun way to display this somewhat eerie effect was to create a website displaying images, descriptions, and video clips of some of my favorite dark TV Shows and Movies made within that last couple of years.

- At the top of the page is just a very basic header with a Title and Subtitle explaining what the site is all about.
