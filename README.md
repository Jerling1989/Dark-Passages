# Dark-Passages
This is a project I decided to create after seeing a tutorial online on how to make a cool "Glitch Effect" when a mouse hovers over an image (or taps on mobile) with some CSS Tricks. I decided a fun way to display this somewhat eerie effect was to create a website displaying images, descriptions, and video clips of some of my favorite dark TV Shows and Movies made within that last couple of years.

- At the top of the page is just a very basic header with a Title and Subtitle explaining what the site is all about.

- When the user hovers their mouse over an Image the glitch effect is formed as well as a subtitle, usually a word describing a main character in the story. This can be partly seen on the "Nightcrawler" image on the left of the screenshot below.

- When the user clicks one of the words underneath the images it will load a Modal that will autoplay a scene, clip, or trailer for the Movie or TV Show they are interested in.

- This last screenshot is just to display the change in color of the words underneath the pictures when a user hovers over them.
